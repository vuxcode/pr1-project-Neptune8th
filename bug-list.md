1. Problem: Website's background color doesn't change into gray. (Fixed)
2. Problem: Text input keeps replace by number if user press any buttons. (Fixed)
3. Problem: Operator and number can't be equal. (Fixed) I rewrote function equal and removed some codes.
4. Problem: If user press one + symbol button then console.log shows two + symbols. (Fixed) Colin found a problem it's += variable. We changed to = variable.
5. Problem: If user press 5 + 2 it will be 7 but instead it shows 52 in console.log. (Fixed) Colin help me fix with index.
6. Problem: If user press 10 - 2 it will be 8 but instead it shows 12 in console.log. (Fixed) Colin helped me put if, else if and else functions. Each functions have now minus, multiplication and division.
