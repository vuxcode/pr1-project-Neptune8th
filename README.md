# User Guide

My program is calculator and I gonna guide you how to use a calculator.

If you run my program then you can see all buttons and one display. Some buttons have numbers and some have operators. 
You can press number in the begining and after you did that then you can choice which operator you like. 
After you choice operator then you can choice the next number after you choice next number then you can press equal.
Then you have an answer now and if you want to remove whole thing then you can press AC button or if you choice the wrong number then you can press DEL button. 
If you want to see console log then look right in the corner and press three dots and press "More tools" and press "Developer tools" and press console. Or press f12.

Note: 
* You can't press operator in the begining! Same as comma and equal. You can only press number in the begining.
* Calculator has a limit with two each numbers. Exemple 20 + 5 = 25
