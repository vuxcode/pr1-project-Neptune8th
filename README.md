# Project Summary

* A description of how you want to present the project to the world
  I have created a calculator but not advance calculator. Calculator is mathematic program that can calculate all kinds operators for instance 234.5+65.34=299.84 or 20/4=5
  and more. Calculator is easy to use and you don't have to calculate in your head.

* A reflection of what your experience of creating the project was like.
  In the begining it was hard because I don't know how to create a button and more but after I got helped, I begin to understand to program a code.
  
* A list of what could be improved on the program if you had more time?
  I want to improve my index because I want my index be more flexible and not hard code. But for now it's very hard or complex to code about calculator.
  
* A conclusion on the budget. Did you manage to stick to the budget? Why? / Why not?
  I have some budget left because I got some tips from our course and I did before but with only script and yes I stick to the budget.
  
* What was your initial idea?
  My first idea is to make a calculator and I still makeing calculator till now. 
  
* How did you create the program?
  I use Visual code and created a html file and css file. Inside html there are head, title, body, input, div, buttons, function, if fuction, else function, console log, id,
  variable, index, array, includes function and more. You can see my code in index.html and Calculator.css
  
* What did you think of the development process?
  In begining I don't know how to create some buttons but after I got tips from our course and more knowledge and I begun to understnd how to code my program.
  After that it went smooth sailing my code.
  
* What problems did you have? How did you solve them?
  I had some problems with the calculator but I had solved all problems and you can see my bug list about how I solved each problem.


# User Guide

My program is calculator and I gonna guide you how to use a calculator.

If you run my program then you can see all buttons and one display. Some buttons have numbers and some have operators. 
You can press number in the begining and after you did that then you can choice which operator you like. 
After you choice operator then you can choice the next number after you choice next number then you can press equal.
Then you have an answer now and if you want to remove whole thing then you can press AC button or if you choice the wrong number then you can press DEL button. 
If you want to see console log then look right in the corner and press three dots and press "More tools" and press "Developer tools" and press console. Or press f12.

Note: 
* You can't press operator in the begining! Same as comma and equal. You can only press number in the begining.
* Calculator has a limit with two each numbers. Exemple 20 + 5 = 25
